# setup_script
my favorite settings for developing server(VPS or Cloud)

## Concept
- Thinclient system based on Apache Guacamole serever for various Operating System.
- End users can access the remote machine with their favorite Web browser(HTML5 supported).

## Caution
setup scripts on this project using the account 'tasat31', so you must replace your own.

ex. On AWS Ubuntu18.04, 'ubuntu' is used.

## Trouble Shooting
If the direcotry "thinclient_drives" is not mounted:

fusermount -zu ~/thinclient_drives
